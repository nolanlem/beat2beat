beat-to-beat notebooks and code for CS230 final project: 
An Adaptive Model of Pulse in Jazz Percussion: Rhythmic Generation in Quasi-Periodic Musical Contexts using Sequence-to-Sequence Learning
Nolan Lem nlem@ccrma.stanford.edu

Note: I removed the weights .h5 files, train/dev/test audio, etc because they're too large! 
In case you are curious,most of the preprocessing code is in: getADT.ipynb and parseMidi.ipynb 
the config file that parameterizes the network is in config/nn_config.py 
the buildModel.ipynb is where I ran most of the code
